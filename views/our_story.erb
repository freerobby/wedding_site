    <h6>As told by <%= BRIDE_FIRST_NAME %></h6>
    <h4>Robby and I met our junior year at Wheaton College, when we had History of America, 1945-present, and National Security Policy together. I knew we had to be friends, when during class he would write music in his journal, and then still have a perfect answer for discussion - and he didn't seem creeped out by me trying to read his journal over his shoulder.</h4>

    <h4>One night, he found me and a mutual friend enjoying popcorn chicken outside the Loft, and he sat down to say helloâ€¦and probably eat our popcorn chicken. We hit it off, and as we walked back to our own dorms, Robby said, "I'm really glad we did this." And that's when I knew it was in the bag!</h4>

    <h4>7 years later, he proposed over fancy drinks and steak - a few steps up from the Loft fried food.</h4>
