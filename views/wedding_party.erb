          Angie and I met our sophomore year at the University of Minnesota. Our dorm rooms were right next to each other. I can still remember the first time I met Angie; I was in a study lounge at our dorm waiting for our House's meeting to start - our House consisted of all the people in the hallway of our dorm. In walks Angie, and she walks right up to me and asks if she can sit to my right. Of course I let her, and she proceeds to introduce herself and talk about a billion other things. I remember thinking to myself, "Wow, this girl is too outgoing. I'll never hang out with her."
          <br /><br />
          I was incredibly wrong. Angie would come over to my room all the time. We'd watch Sex and the City and hang out. Our junior and senior year, we ended up living together, and she's a huge reason why I kept some sanity in college. 
          <br /><br />
          Angie is ridiculous, blunt, and unfiltered which makes me laugh. But she's also kind and supportive. I'm so lucky to call her my friend. 
          <br /><br />
          Angie lives in Minnesota with the love of her life - her dog, Oscar.

          Michele is Michael’s favorite sister – I can say this because she is his only sister. I’m going to admit, I was really nervous about meeting Michael’s family, but Michele completely put me at ease. The first time we met, we discussed important topics like Michael’s absurdly large t-shirt collection and, equally as large, DVD collection. Actually, that conversation was the first time I had heard about Michael’s DVD collection – I later realized that was what the 4 large, blue tubs were in our basement. Michele definitely has her brother pegged. I have her to thank for our lovely leg lamp which sits on my nightstand next time I see her. 
          <br /><br />
          Michele is hilarious. And even though we don’t see each other very often, it’s always a delight when we do!
          <br /><br />
          Michele lives in South Carolina. Unlike her brother, she does not like snow and cold weather.

          Monica is my younger, and only, sister. We’ve shared many lovely experiences together, including a room while our parents renovated our house. That actually was not so lovely. And now, even though we are six years and 1,000 miles apart, Monica and I are super close. We bond over our enjoyment of tennis, embarrassing parents, and love for the television show FRIENDS. "How you doin?"
          <br /><br />
          Monica is insanely brave. No matter what life throws at her, she attacks in head on and with her gorgeous smile. She is one of my biggest inspirations, and I love her to death!
          <br /><br />
          Monica lives with my parents. Don’t worry; she’s still in high school so it’s cool.

        Allie Bartak
      </p>
      <div>
        <p style="text-align:left;">
          Allie is one of my coworkers, but I consider her part of my New England family. When I first moved to Boston, I didn’t know anyone. And even though she didn’t have to, Allie made sure I transitioned okay and had things to do on the weekend. Allie was also my caretaker when I wound up in the emergency room with an awful case of strep throat and mono – I know my mom really appreciated that! Allie also played matchmaker for me and Michael. She says that she knew we would be good for each other because we are both tall. 
          <br /><br />
          Allie is extremely caring and can always pick me up when I’m feeling down. She recently became a new mom, and I know she’s going to be a kick ass one!
          <br /><br />
          Allie lives in New Hampshire with her husband, Dan (Michael’s partner in crime), and their beautiful baby boy, Baxter.

      <p style="font-weight:bold;color:#243350;">
        Dan Whitmoyer
      </p>

        <img src="images/wedding_party/dan.jpg" alt="Dan" width=250 height=200 style="float:right;margin-left:10px;margin-top:10px;"/>
        <p style="text-align:left;">
          I first met Dan when I moved to a new apartment that I would be sharing with two people I knew and this other random guy who had been living there already. Initially we did not speak. Then over a topic/situation I cannot recall, and what was likely an unhealthy amount of alcohol we started screaming at each other and a friendship was born.
          <br/><br/>
          Dan and I have shared an incredible number or ridiculous adventures over the years we have known each other, from chopping up a fence in our back yard for fire wood (we rented) to getting lost carrying kayaks up a mountain near the Canadian border. No matter how innocent something starts out, it typically ends in a disaster of some sort.
          <br/><br/>
          With myself and the rest of the groomsman being over six feet, it will certainly be entertaining to see Dan at 5'4" in the mix.
          <br/><br/>
          It is an honor to have Dan as my bestman.

        Goss Nuzzo-Jones

        <p style="text-align:left;">
          Hailing from the great West(ern) Virginia, Goss and I first met while in grad school at Worcester Polytechnic Institute where we were both research assistants in the AI Lab. During our time at WPI, we would grow to become good friends, particularly at the Sahara (a local bar/restaurant) while grabbing a few drinks and stealing all the free chips we could get our hands on (so good).
          <br/><br/>
          After grad school, we were able to work together again and would live together in one of Cambridge's fine apartments with revolutionary window controlled heating systems (basically if you wanted it to cool down from the typical 95 degrees you opened the window). We have taken part in many great shenanigans over the years and to this day I consider myself lucky to have Goss as one of my close friends.
          <br/><br/>
          It is an honor to have Goss as one of my groomsmen.

        <p style="text-align:left;">
          Andrew has been my little brother all of his life. A great accomplishment for him if you ask me.
          <br/><br/>
          While it may or may not be true that I pushed him down the stairs in his baby walker in an attempt to get rid of him, I could not have asked for a better little brother then Andrew. Growing up together we were a constant force for each other to get better at whatever sport/activity we were undertaking. While we may not be participating in the same activities these days, that same desire to get better and be better that was shaped way back then still drives me today. 
          <br/><br/>
          Although we do not get to see each other as often as we should it is still great when we do get together, whether it be for a relaxing vacation or family event.
          <br/><br/>
          It is an honor to have Andrew as one of my groomsmen.

        <p style="text-align:left;">
          I was not nervous for one second when I first met Rachel's family (yea right!). But even so, when I did meet them, Kevin was very nice and welcoming. He even let me use his room! He may or may not have been forced to do so by his mother but I still thought it was very nice that he gave up the comforts of his own room to someone he was just meeting.
          <br/><br/>
          It is always refreshing when I visit the Zettel's, or they visit us, to talk with Kevin and experience his seemingly always upbeat nature. Rachel no doubt learned a thing or two from her younger brother. I could not have asked for a better future brother-in-law.
          <br/><br/>
          It is an honor to have Kevin as one of my groomsmen.
